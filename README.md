# Machine Learning for Trading

## Course Summary
This course introduces students to the real world challenges of implementing machine learning based trading strategies including the algorithmic steps from information gathering to market orders. The focus is on how to apply probabilistic machine learning approaches to trading decisions. We consider statistical approaches like linear regression, Q-Learning, KNN, and regression trees and how to apply them to actual stock trading situations.

## What I learned
This course taught me the basics behind algorithmic training including building tree ensembles from pure numpy and reinforcemnt learning from numpy. Throughout this course, we utilized object oriented Python programming to build out various different models. Due to the Georgia Tech Honor code, I cannot post the work that I did leading up to the final project, but I can share the final project paper that I completed, where I build both a manual trading strategy and a trading bot using a model that I had built with no external machine learning library or framework.
